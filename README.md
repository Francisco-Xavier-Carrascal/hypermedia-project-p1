## Information Architecture

The website’s information is structured to provide an intuitive and streamlined experience for potential employers or collaborators. At the top of the page, users will find a **header section** featuring the individual’s name, a brief tagline, and a professional photo that immediately introduces the user and displays their identity. Below this header, there are two main columns, each containing specific information blocks.  

- The **left column** includes essential information such as a contact section with phone number, email, and location, followed by skills, education, and language proficiency. This column provides recruiters with a quick overview of the individual’s competencies and educational background.  

- The **right column** contains a personal profile section, a work experience section, and a list of completed courses.
